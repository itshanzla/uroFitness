## 🎯 WHAT TO DO NEXT (Priority Order)

### **IMMEDIATE (Next Steps):**

#### 1. Create Week Navigation System
- Add "Optimal Flow Blueprint™" link to sidebar
- Create week overview page showing all 12 weeks
- Design week card/list layout (calm, minimal)
- Show phase groupings (Phase 1-4)

#### 2. Build ONE Representative Week Page (Week 1)
**Template Structure:**
```
Week 1 — What's Actually Happening
├── Concept (expandable)
│   └── Educational content (2-4 min read)
├── Primary Action (expandable)
│   └── ONE required behavior
├── Reinforcement (expandable)
│   └── Stack previous habits
├── Optional Amplifier (expandable, clearly labeled "Optional")
│   └── Optional extra behavior
└── Close
    └── "That's it this week."
```

**Requirements:**
- Expand/collapse sections
- Calm, educational tone
- No urgency language
- Clear visual distinction for "Optional"
- ONE primary action only

#### 3. Update Sidebar Navigation
- Remove "Optimal Flow Blueprint™" from current position
- Add it as a main navigation item
- Link to week overview page

#### 4. Test & Verify
- ☐ Only ONE required action visible per week
- ☐ Optional items visually distinct
- ☐ No urgency or performance pressure
- ☐ Structure matches weekly template
- ☐ UI supports understanding, not motivation

### **LATER (After Week 1 Template Approved):**
- Replicate Week 1 template for remaining 11 weeks
- Add Fast-Track feature (after Week 2)
- Add week completion indicators (if requested)
- Wire up actual content for all weeks

### **NOT NEEDED NOW:**
- ❌ Backend logic
- ❌ Tracking/scoring/analytics
- ❌ Progress meters or streaks
- ❌ All 12 weeks fully wired

## 📝 NOTES

1. Client is happy with current progress
2. New spec is for alignment - not immediate implementation
3. Focus on building ONE week template first
4. Get approval before building all 12 weeks
5. Structure is locked - don't change without approval
6. Tone is critical - calm, educational, no pressure
